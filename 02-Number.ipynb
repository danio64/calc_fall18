    "Natural numbers are so named as they are often believed to be the most natural use of number -- counting and ordering.  Often, we imagine number represented by a symbol like 3, but we can also consider a Natural Number as related to some geometric object like a point or sqaure representing a single unit.  To get used to what may be a more visual way of thinking about mathematical objects, we will investigate some properties of natural numbers and the possibility to *prove* these true.  \n",

This number cannot be replicated as the quotient of integer quantities.  Early societies like the Babylonians had methods for determining this quantity; we will follow them here.  To do so, we begin by recognizing the relationship called the **Pythagorean Theorem**.  This *theorem* represents a relationship between legs of a right triangle and the hypotenuse.
