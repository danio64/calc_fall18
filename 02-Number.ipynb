    "Natural numbers are so named as they are often believed to be the most natural use of number -- counting and ordering.  Often, we imagine number represented by a symbol like 3, but we can also consider a Natural Number as related to some geometric object like a point or sqaure representing a single unit.  To get used to what may be a more visual way of thinking about mathematical objects, we will investigate some properties of natural numbers and the possibility to *prove* these true.  \n",

First, it's important to recognize that our symbolic representation is not to be taken for granted.  This is a human invention to aid in the use of number as a tool for society.

To understand such a thing is often the focus of early grades mathematical teaching, and accordingly has seen a variety of material technologies emerge to support students learning.

For now, let's consider a contemporary task that illustrates what we expect students to know about rational numbers.\n",
